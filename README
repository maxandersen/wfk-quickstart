Quickstarts (or examples, or samples) for Web Framework Kit. There are a number of rules for quickstarts:

    Each quickstart should have a unique name, this enables a user to quickly identify each quickstart
    A quickstart should have a simple build that the user can quickly understand. If using maven it should:
        Not inherit from another POM
        Import the various BOMs from WFK2 to get version numbers
        Use the JBoss AS Maven Plugin to deploy the example - for now N/A
    The quickstart should be importable into JBoss Tools and deployable there
    The quickstart should be explained in detail in the associated user guide, including how to deploy

You can find the documentation at ???.

If you add a quickstart, don't forget to update this README.
